            A nordic Companyâ€™s vision is a salon that provides a personal and
            calming environment for everyone. With us you can focus on you, wind
            down and leave feeling confident and energized. As a Scandinavian
            native, we have brought along a Swedish product line enriched with
            natural extracts from the Swedish forests but with a clear purpose &
            result. Sleek design, vegan, sustainable throughout, and with scents
            you fall for. Coming in to fix your hair or lashes means a moment to
            focus on you. Enjoy a lovely coffee from our coffee bar, have a nap
            on our super comfortable lash bed, and with every hair service, we
            provide a deep clean & scalp massage. We make time for you.
